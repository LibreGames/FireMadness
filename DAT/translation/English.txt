001: PROLOGUE
002: It's 11th April 2116. My antivirus license had expired. Viruses took over my home droids that ran on SoftMadness (R) Doors operation system and they won't let me to my refrigerator... I was absolutely sure I could survive a month on food crumbs in my keyboard in case of zombie apocalypse. In reality they weren't even enough for two weeks... The only option to death from starvation is to fight my way through. Luckily I still have an old and reliable opensource-based droid I can operate. It's kill 'em all or die trying!
003: BEDROOM
004: The bots won't let me go away from my computer. It's time to show them who is the boss here. It's my home and it's time to get it back!
005: LIVING ROOM
006: I've cleared my way to the living room, but it's crawling with droids. I can see the kitchen door from here. I'm too close to fail!
007: CELLAR
008: I knew it! They've barred the kitchen door safe and sound and sealed it with a password. It'd take days to break through! But luckily there is a backdoor through the cellar. Creepy dark room I've instructed droids to clean and fix. So long since I've been there last time. If I were a droid I would have undoubtedly made my hideout there.
009: KITCHEN
010: There we go! The trap door is open and I can see the fridge! But kitchen appliances don't seem to give up that easily. It's the most epic moment to say: "It's now or never!"
011: ATTIC
012: Finally! They're gone for good and I could get my first snack in three days! But there are still many droids in the house. It's time to strike them where it really hurts. I'm going for the beast! I'll bring down the Fi-Wi router and I'm damn serious to return MY home under MY control! It's time to end this madness once and for all!!! BANZAAAAAAI!!!
013: EPILOGUE
014: Awesome job! With Fi-Wi down, SoftMadness (R) Doors OS could not connect to the dedicated masters and all the mad proprietary bots were shut down due to license violation. My home is clean, safe and comfortable once again. Now the life seems a little... boring? Maybe I should buy a few more proprietary droids and go for another round, but on higher difficulty? ;)

# bots descriptions

015: Polymorph stage 1
016: A simple proprietary multi-tool turned into a deadly weapon. Quick but inefficient.
017: Polymorph stage 2
018: A simple proprietary multi-tool turned into a deadly weapon in fully-deployed state. Rather tough, but still a piece of a cake.
019: Polymorph stage 3
020: Ultimate form of a proprietary swiss-army-knife multi-tool. Challenging.
021: Disabler
022: This proprietary air purification system uses high voltage to collect dust from the atmosphere. Its charge causes short circuits that make target temporarily unable to fire and highly vulnerable to damage. Harmless alone but deadly with support.
023: Heavy bot
024: A large proprietary transportation platform for carrying heavy stuff and luggage around. Slow, but deadly.
025: Regenrator
026: "It doesn't require maintenance", they said. "It's capable of self-repair", they said. "It runs on latest SM Doors version", they said.
027: Defender
028: Once I've used that one to open, close and minimize windows and doors... Now it uses its forcefields for other purposes.
029: Healer
030: Seems that this repair droid is also insane. However it does its job of repairing its proprietary friends unreasonably well.
031: Teleporter
032: I've always wondered how many of those I've had? Because it always shows up in different places. They've claimed it only collected anonymous privacy data to show me relevant ads...
033: Crossfire
034: An ultra powerful vacuum cleaner that runs on commercial software went mad. I didn't know it had weapons installed...
035: Bomber
036: In past days I've used this one to dispose of garbage. Very intuitive WYSIWYG interface by SoftMadness... Now it's eager to dispose of me.
037: Bomb
038: An autonomous proprietary garbage packaging unit packed up with explosive proprietary garbage.
039: Carrier
040: Who might have thought a harmless SoftMadness (R) Doors mosquito defense system may consider me... a mosquito?
041: Fighter
042: Tiny mosquito hunter. Very quick but fragile.
043: Fi-Wi router
044: A powerful Fi-Wi router to access the Outernet. Used by SM Doors OS to connect to SoftMadness (R) dedicated masters to validate the license information every few seconds. If it's down, the droids will automatically power off due to EULA violation. But it seems to have access to my credit card to commission more droids from SoftMadness corp on-line...
045: Player-1
046: A simple free and open-source droid I've used a while. It's 100% virus-proof, solid and efficient, but takes some time to get used to due to ugly GUI. This might be my only chance to survive.
047: Player-2
048: Toy carriage with a 10-megawatt laser pointer my cat used to play with. Based on free and open-source software. Might my cat give me a hand with fighting those crazy hostile proprietary bots?
